# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-06)

**Core value:** Accurate, trustworthy usage visibility — the user always knows where they stand against their plan limits without trusting third-party code with their data.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Core Parsing

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation & Core Parsing)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-07 — Roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0.0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: N/A
- Trend: N/A

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Local JSONL parsing only (trust — no API keys or network access needed)
- Always-on status bar (user wants constant visibility, not just alerts)
- Auto-learn + manual override for rate limits (Max plan limits aren't documented; learn from reality but allow correction)
- Account-wide tracking (rate limits are per-account, not per-project)
- esbuild bundler (fast builds, small output, standard for VS Code extensions)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 uncertainty: Claude Code JSONL format for rate-limit events is undocumented. May require experimental approach and iteration based on real session data.
- Token aggregation accuracy is critical from Phase 1. Must verify against Claude.ai web UI to avoid 5-10x inflation errors seen in other extensions.
